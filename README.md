# Block Blog (A Decentralised Blogging Platform)

## Description

This project is a full-stack JavaScript application that uses Solidity smart contracts on the backend and a React frontend. The application allows users to create and view blog posts as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. `backend/`: This directory contains the server-side JavaScript code, including the Express routes for the blog API.

2. `contracts/`: This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts for the BlogNFT.

3. `frontend/`: This directory contains the client-side React code, including components for the blog form, blog post, cards, and header.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies: Run `npm install` in the root directory, as well as in the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

2. Start the backend server: Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run `node index.js`.

3. Start the frontend server: Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run `npm start`.

## Usage

To use the application, navigate to the homepage in your web browser. From there, you can create new blog posts and view existing ones.
